# OfficeLife Developer Documentation

Welcome to OfficeLife - a great, easy to use yet complete, open-source Human Capital Management software.

This documentation is aimed towards developers working with (or contributing to) the OfficeLife project, and advanced users who want to install OfficeLife on their servers. If this is your first time hearing about OfficeLife, we recommend starting with the OfficeLife website.

The documentation is split into two sections:

* the [documentation for developers](developers/guidelines.md) who want to contribute to the sofware. It contains general guidelines, help on common questions and the best practices we want to enforce.
* the [documentation for core contributors](core-contributors/installation.md) who maintain the project on a daily basis. It contains guidelines on how to maintain our servers, deployment processes and team structure.
