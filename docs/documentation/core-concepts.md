# Core concepts

## Introduction

OfficeLife tries very hard to be very simple. However, to understand the product completely, you need to understand its core concepts.

At the core is the notion of employee. Everything in OfficeLife evolves around what employees do.

## Employee

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the central place of OfficeLife. It gives an overview to all employees of **what they can do** and **what they should know**. More specifically, here is an overview of what users can do:

* As an employee:
  * you can indicate if you work from home,
  * you can tell what youâ€™ve done today,
  * you can tell how you felt today,
  * you can answer questions that let your colleagues know more about you.
* As a team member,
  * you can read who has done what this week,
  * you can see who works from home,
  * you can see who has a birthday today, in the current team.
