# Applicant tracking system

## Overview

OfficeLife's mission is to manage the entire employee lifecycle, which actually starts at the recruiting stage.

Since we manage everything that's going on with an employee in the company, it makes sense to manage the recruiting as well. In the HR world, these kind of features are called an Applicant Tracking System, or <acronym title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</acronym>.

Like everything we do, we will focus on what an <acronym title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</acronym> is all about, and skip features that are less used. Here is basically how recruiting works with OfficeLife:

* someone with the HR role creates an open position, which is linked to an [existing job position](/documentation/manage/employee-management.html#employee-positions),
* an open position consists of:
  * a title,
  * a content,
* an open position is sponsored by someone in the company (usually the manager of the team which recruits but it can be anyone in the company),
* open positions can be managed by someone with the HR or administrator role, or by the sponsor of this opening,
* all the open positions are public (on the internet) and can be consulted by anyone in the world at an URL that is unique to the company's account,
* someone will apply to the open position by submitting his CV and some relevant information,
* when someone applies, the relevant employees can see it and take actions to interview the candidate,
* candidates can go through any number of phases that the company needs,
* once the company wants to hire the candidate, an offer is made, and once accepted, the candidate can be transformed to an employee in the system,
* the job opening can be closed, and the new employee can use OfficeLife as a new employee.

Isn't that simple and beautiful?
