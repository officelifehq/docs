# Management of the company

## Company information

### Overview

Every company has some specific details: name, currency used, timezone.

OfficeLife lets you customize some aspects of your company, without giving too many settings to play with. We believe that settings should be avoided as much as possible. But some things... well, some things should be configurable.

### Update company’s name

Your company’s name is saved when you first create your company’s account. However, you can always change it as much as you want – although we suspect you won’t have to change the name that often.

That being said, updating the name is really easy. Click on the Rename button and choose a new name. The name will be instantly changed everywhere in the software and all documents that you can export.

::: tip Rules
* Only someone with the administrator role can update the company name.
* The name of the company should be no longer than 255 characters.

## Currency

### Overview

Every company needs to deal with money at some point. Money is represented by a currency. In OfficeLife, at the moment, a company can only have one active currency.

Currencies in OfficeLife strictly follow the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) specification, meaning that they are defined by a three letters code. Thus, Euro is `EUR`, US dollars is `USD` and so on.

Current features that use the concept of company currency:

* Expenses.

### Defining the company’s currency

By default, when you create your OfficeLife account, your account is assigned a default currency automatically: USD, or US dollars. You can change this in Adminland.

Go to Adminland section, under general, and indicate which currency is the default in your company.

::: tip Rules
* Only someone with the administrator role can change the currency used in the company.

## Logo

A company can express its identity through its visual identity. When the company logo is set, it will appear on the Company's dashboard under the Company tab.

To upload or change the logo of the company, go to Adminland > General, and simply click on the Logo at the bottom of the page.

* The logo will be seen by anyone in the company.

### Defining the company’s founded date

The company's date of creation is displayed on the Company tab in your account. It's a nice detail so everyone knows how resilient the company is (or young, in that case). You can change this date in Adminland.

Go to Adminland section, under general, and indicate when the company has been created.

::: tip Rules
* Only someone with the administrator role can change this date.
* You only have to indicate the year the company has been founded.

## Account cancellation

You are in complete control of your data. You can cancel the company's account at anytime.

Keep in mind, though, that cancelling the company's account means

* all the data will be immediately deleted from the servers. Immediately.
* data is kept in the backups for 60 days. After 60 days, the backups will be deleted. We won't be able to restore your data from the backup, though.

::: tip Rules
* Only someone with the administrator role can cancel the company's account.
