# Time tracking

## Overview

Time tracking is an essential piece of information for most companies. It gives the ability to know where the focus of an employee, a team or the entire company currently is. It also helps to understand the financial health of a project, especially if those projects have a fixed budget. Finally, and last but not least, if we combine time tracking with the worklogs feature, and/or the employee morale, this will give us unique insights on how the employee performs, or how he struggles so we can help him.

## How does time tracking work in OfficeLife

Like everything we do in OfficeLife, we try to keep features as simple as possible. Time tracking is no different - it’s simple to understand, simple to use and works as you think it works.

### Timesheets and time tracking entries

Time tracking is about timesheets.

A timesheet is a list of time tracking entries. An entry is a number of hours spent on something. Each time tracking entry can also be associated with a project if there is a need.

All employees in OfficeLife can use the time tracking feature, as it’s enabled by default on every company’s account.

### Statuses

A timesheet has several statuses over the course of its lifetime:

* open,
* ready to submit,
* approved or rejected.

Every week, employees must submit their timesheets. If an employee has a manager, the timesheet needs to be approved by the manager. If the employee doesn't have a manager, the timesheet is automatically approved upon submission.

### Privacy

Like with every other features in OfficeLife, privacy has been taken into account with this feature. No regular employees can see someone else’s timesheets. Only employees with a specific right can read them:

* the manager of the employee, if defined,
* employees with HR or admin roles,
* employees with the Accountant role.

### Where do time tracking entries appear?

While an employee creates an entry on his dashboard, time tracking entries appear on several places in OfficeLife:

* on the Employee’s own page,
* on the Employee’s dashboard,
* on the Manager’s dashboard page,
* on the Finance tab on the Project page, if those entries are about a given project,
* on the Finance tab on the Company page.

## Creating a time tracking entry

Creating a time tracking entry is always made on the employee dashboard, even if it’s about a project.

To create an entry, an employee needs to enter:

* a duration: the duration is written in hours and minutes. While OfficeLife will make sure that this duration doesn't exceed 24 hours, it won't limit employees otherwise.
* a project: this field is not necessary, but if it is, this entry will be linked to the project.
* an optional description. Not required, but can be used to give an additional context.

OfficeLife will make sure that you can not enter more than 24 hours for all entries in a given day.
